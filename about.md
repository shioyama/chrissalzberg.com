I am a freelance software engineer based in Japan with many years of experience
building and maintaining web applications for the Japanese market. I believe in
quality code and quality communication, and see the two as intimately related.

A Canadian originally from Montreal, I first came to Japan as a researcher
and later discovered a love for programming. I have headed international teams
in public organizations and private companies, tackling problems ranging from
disseminating scientific discoveries to integrating legacy payment systems.
The common thread linking these roles is the importance of clear communication
to quality results.

My go-to programming languages are **Ruby** and **Javascript**, and for
building web applications I use **Ruby on Rails** (which I know [inside
out](/speaking#the-elusive-attribute)). I am also open to languages
and frameworks outside my daily technology stack, and to roles other than
software engineer, for example product evangelist.

I am available for fixed-term or recurring contract work. I am currently
in Tokyo and may be available for initial on-site consulting, but generally I
work remote. I can join a team, work independently, or collaborate across
groups or between companies.

### What I can do for you

Some of the areas I can offer value to teams and companies:

- Application design and architecture
- Legacy code analysis, rewrite and rescue
- Product design, strategy and prototyping
- Code reviews
- Team communication and mentoring
- System integration, e.g. via APIs
- Evangelizing products and services, particularly to a developer audience
- Promotional or technical writing, content creation for a technical audience

In addition to the above, as a fluent Japanese speaker with technical
expertise, I offer a unique set of skills for companies integrating with
Japanese systems or collaborating with Japanese stakeholders. If this sounds
like you, please reach out and [let's talk](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

### Specialties

- Ruby on Rails internals (especially ActiveModel/ActiveRecord)
- Payment integration
- E-commerce and logistics
- Internationalization and localization, translation management
